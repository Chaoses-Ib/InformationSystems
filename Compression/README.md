# Compression
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression)

> In information theory, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.

Repetition is just a property of some data that can be used to transform them into a shorter form, at the cost of tranforming other data into a longer form.

[Maximum file compression benchmark 7Z ARC ZIPX versus RAR](https://peazip.github.io/maximum-compression-benchmark.html)
- ZPAQ is clearly the top performing format in this benchmark focused on maximum attainable compression.
- ZPAQ and ARC are the best compressors, but 7Z and RAR formats has a clear advantage in terms of decompression speed, faster than for any other tested format.
- 7Z outperformed RAR in terms of compression ratio at all compression levels, but RAR outperformed 7Z in terms of compression speed.
- Brotli and Zstd can provide surprisingly good compression ratios, even if they are designed primarily for fast compression tasks, with Zstandard being overall the best choice.

  > 
  > Zlib-ng decompression takes about 57% less time than zlib (w/zlib-ng minigzip), and 43% less time than gzip.
  > 
  > Zlib-ng loses a little on compressed size (due to 4-byte minimum match size instead of 3-byte). Level 6 zlib-ng loses with 41.038% vs 40.813% compressed size for gzip. Level 9 has 40.696% vs 40.549%.

  > Our research with RocksDB and Zlib-ng shows that there is ~50% less throughput and ~45% latency increase in Zlib-ng vs Zstandard. Also not much difference observed in Compression ratios.

    > zlib-rs (and zlib-ng) trades some compression ratio for speed so it doesn't compress as well as standard zlib and miniz\_oxide. This may or may not be desirable depending on application so it's somthing that has to be considered. When testing `cloudflare-zlib` it seemed like it was somewhere inbetween zlib and zlib-ng/zlib-rs on compression ratio and speed so maybe does some speed/ratio tradeoffs but not all (zlib and miniz/miniz\_oxide also has some slight differences in compression ratio characteristics but that's more a small variance that can go slightly either way due to slight difference in implementation rather than better/worse).

> The only reason to use bzip2 for “general purpose” compression is if you have to use bzip2 because an upstream mandates it, bzip2 has not been a good general purpose compression format since LZMA appeared: LZMA will always beat bzip2 in decompression speed, and will generally beat its compression ratio at any given CPU time, bzip2 only beats LZMA on memory use (especially on compression, but also decompression for very high LZMA modes). Bzip2 can be superior for specific data patterns which happen to fit BWT, but the odds are low.

## Solid compression
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_compression)

> Solid compression is a method for data compression of multiple files, wherein all the uncompressed files are concatenated and treated as a single data block. Such an archive is called a solid archive.

> It is used natively in the 7z and RAR formats, as well as indirectly in tar-based formats such as `.tar.gz` and `.tar.bz2`. By contrast, the ZIP format is not solid because it stores separately compressed files (though solid compression can be emulated for small archives by combining the files into an uncompressed archive file and then compressing that archive file inside a second compressed ZIP file).

## Cryptography
> Cryptosystems often compress data (the "plaintext") before encryption for added security. When properly implemented, compression greatly increases the unicity distance by removing patterns that might facilitate cryptanalysis. However, many ordinary lossless compression algorithms produce headers, wrappers, tables, or other predictable output that might instead make cryptanalysis easier. Thus, cryptosystems must utilize compression algorithms whose output does not contain these predictable patterns.
