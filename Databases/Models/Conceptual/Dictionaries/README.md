# Data Dictionaries
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary)

> A **data dictionary**, or metadata repository, is a "centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format".

> If a data dictionary system is used only by the designers, users, and administrators and not by the DBMS Software, it is called a **passive data dictionary**. Otherwise, it is called an **active data dictionary** or data dictionary. When a passive data dictionary is updated, it is done so manually and independently from any changes to a DBMS (database) structure. With an active data dictionary, the dictionary is updated first and changes occur in the DBMS automatically as a result.
