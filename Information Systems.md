> A (Unix) file system is a hierarchical database for unstructured untyped data. The BeFS is more like a metadata-addressable graph of semi-structured data. The VMS filesystem is a hierarchical database for semi-structured versioned data. The OS/400 filesystem is actually pretty close to SQL in its semantics. Different filesystems are very different!
