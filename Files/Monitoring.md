  Network drives:
  > `ReadDirectoryChangesW` works with network drives, but only if the remote server supports the functionality. Drives shared from other Windows-based computers will correctly generate notifications. Samba servers may or may not generate notifications, depending on whether the underlying operating system supports the functionality. ~~Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices usually run Linux, so won't support notifications.~~ High-end SANs are anybody's guess.

  > Monitoring SAMBA servers (eg NAS) will actually work in many cases. The more modern Linux operating systems upon which these are based, and the more modern versions of SAMBA, will all support notifications. It can be hit and miss. I have found a number of NAS boxes where it works OK.

  Changes between calls:
  > When you first call ReadDirectoryChangesW, the system allocates a buffer to store change information. This buffer is associated with the directory handle until it is closed and its size does not change during its lifetime. Directory changes that occur between calls to this function are added to the buffer and then returned with the next call. If the buffer overflows, the entire contents of the buffer are discarded and the lpBytesReturned parameter contains zero.
