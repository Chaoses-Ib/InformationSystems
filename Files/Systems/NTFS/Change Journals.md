# Change Journals
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USN_Journal)

> The change journal file, `\$Extend\$UsnJrnl`, is a sparse file in which NTFS stores records of changes to files and directories. Applications like the Windows File Replication Service (FRS) and the Windows Search service make use of the journal to respond to file and directory changes as they occur.[^winter]

## Standard information
- Last modification date and time
  - Write -> `USN_REASON_DATA_OVERWRITE`, `USN_REASON_DATA_EXTEND` or `USN_REASON_DATA_TRUNCATION`
  - Touch -> `USN_REASON_BASIC_INFO_CHANGE`

  However, `USN_RECORD` does not contain the new time.

## Hard links
- Create: `USN_REASON_HARD_LINK_CHANGE`
- Delete: `USN_REASON_HARD_LINK_CHANGE`
- Rename: same as normal files

## API
> An application can configure the NTFS change journal facility by using the `DeviceIoControl` functionâ€™s `FSCTL_CREATE_USN_JOURNAL` file system control code (USN is update sequence number) to have NTFS record information about file and directory changes to an internal file called the change Mournal. A change journal is usually large enough to virtually guarantee that applications get a chance to process changes without missing any. Applications use the `FSCTL_QUERY_USN_JOURNAL` file system control code to read records from a change journal, and they can specify that the `DeviceIoControl` function not complete until new records are available.[^winter]
